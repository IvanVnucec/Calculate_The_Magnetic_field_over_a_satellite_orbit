## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Program requires [Aerospace Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/aerospace-toolbox.html) to be already installed.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository,
2. Open `main.m` file and there you have orbit parameters to tweak.


## Running
To get some data out of the system one should:
1. Modify the orbit parameters and UTC time,
2. Press Run button.
